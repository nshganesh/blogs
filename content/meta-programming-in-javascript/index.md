Introduction

[Metaprogramming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming) is a technique in which _a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze, or transform other programs, and even modify itself while_ **_running_**_. In simple terms, a code which is running will introspect itself and be able to modify / transform itself. Doesnâ€™t that sound magical and powerful?_

  

We will start with a simple explanation of what client side javascript does: At runtime, accepts inputs, we transform this input to our likings, make a network call, receive the result of network calls and again transform to our likings.
