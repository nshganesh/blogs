Medium forced me to add a photo!

[https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) is a great place to start learning and scaling react webapps without any hassle. I really like it’s quick scaffolding and offline first capabilities. It uses redux-saga as a middleware to handle all business logic. Even though redux-saga is awesome, I always felt that [redux-logic](https://github.com/jeffbski/redux-logic) is more cleaner and scalable with ease.

So I decided to tweak the above react-boilerplate and change only the middleware logic. You can find the above changes in this [repo](https://github.com/nshganesh/react-redux-logic-boilerplate). Quick scaffolding also supports redux logic instead of redux-saga. If you are also a fan of redux-logic, hope it helps you to setup your next react project.
