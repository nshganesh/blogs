[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are getting more and more popular. When I started coding React, I liked the pattern of class components. Which resembles the Android activity/fragment lifecycles. Which made it easy to understand for people coming from OOP to functional paradigm.

React hooks completely hide the lifecycle methods. Still offers to add local state to the functional components. It is impressing how it eliminates boilerplate when using class components. Even though React has no plans to remove class components, understanding basic hooks give immense power during coding. I was playing with hooks and impressed by the power of it.
