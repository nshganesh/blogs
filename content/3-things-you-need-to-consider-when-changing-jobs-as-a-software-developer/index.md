When it comes to changing jobs, people become perplexed. They are either afraid or unable to determine whether the idea is good or bad. It is impossible to give a definitive answer because different people prefer different things. It is critical that you understand what you want from your current employer and, if possible, what you want from your next employer. This blog will attempt to provide you with a conceptual framework for determining when it is time to look for your next job. There are far too many variables to consider for it to be a one-stop shop. This blog will attempt to provide a starting point for your decision to change jobs. A major decision that will affect you both personally and professionally.

#### Growth

Growth can refer to a variety of things in the software industry. Depending on the roles you currently hold, your growth path may differ. The reason for this is that there are numerous approaches you could take to your career. Backend developer, full stack developer, DevOps, frontend developer, software developer test, product manager, engineering manager, vice president, and director are all examples of this.

Your manager, the people you interact with on a daily basis, the type of work / problem you have to solve every day, or the learnings you receive every day could all contribute to your growth.

You must ask yourself some critical questions:

1.  Are you satisfied with the tech stacks you are working on?
2.  Are you being challenged sufficiently each day?

You must determine whether you have mastered the field in which you work. Even so, it’s difficult to gauge how much one should know. If you are new, the best way to get started is to compare yourself to the best developer you know.

As a senior developer, you should ask yourself:

1.  Are your technical decisions taken into account? If not, are they given a logical reason why they should not do so?
2.  Is it actively helping you in raising your level? Many companies along the way make you believe that helping new employees is the responsibility of senior developers. You must rise from that in order to help yourself grow.

People with whom you interact on a daily basis help you grow tremendously. Most people do not understand this, but the best way to feel it is to look at the answers they provide and the way they behave in a meeting, during a heated conversation. You are either taking something positive from it. Or you are doing something in your career that you should not be doing. Consider putting yourself in their shoes. It aids in gaining perspective. Examining the issue from their perspective. It is important to admire what people can do rather than people themselves.

#### Promotion

Again, in the beginning, you should avoid thinking about this. Companies compete on level and salary to retain talent. You could be a senior developer earning less than a junior developer who negotiated better terms. If you are a newcomer, you should take this with a grain of salt and prioritise growth during switching companies.

A senior developer should ideally seek to promote, either by changing companies or by negotiating effectively with the current ones. The reason for this is that as you advance in your career, you will be given more complex tasks, which in turn provides growth. Having a sufficient knowledge of programming can assist companies in nurturing their talent pool. Also who can also be an individual contributor to make a significant impact. Companies are always looking for great talent to fill vacancies, and for those talents, companies will and do create specific roles if necessary.

#### Money

This should be given less weightage in the early years. Assume you begin as a frontend developer but are also interested in and passionate about backend development. Salary will be an impediment to you moving away from that. Having a lower salary and exposure to the full stack (read: growth) would, for example, provide you with rocket fuel to propel your career forward. Companies will try to limit your growth and will only give you a raise if your growth exceeds their expectations. Having a lower salary but exponential growth gives you more freedom and better opportunities later in your career.

If you are a senior developer, comparing your salary to that of other competitors or product companies will give you an idea of where you stand. If that isn’t enough, You should sharpen your skills and be ready to switch.

Money, Promotion, and Growth These three factors will help you decide how to approach your next job search. You could include more factors in determining whether or not to change jobs. For example: job stability, remote work flexibility, alignment with company values, emotional outbursts (it happens! ), and so on.

I hope this blog provided you a direction for you to brainstorm. Good luck!
