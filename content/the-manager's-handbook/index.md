1.  Management requires wearing many different hats. Some days you’re the recruiter, some days the coach, some days the conflict resolver, and some days the tiebreaker. If you can become great at all these things, then the score will take care of itself. Your team will perform, and you will feel a lot of satisfaction from watching them fly.
2.  Promoting a person more often than not is a classic trap companies fall into. What often happen next is you end up losing a great IC (individual contributors) and gaining a mediocre manager. Not good!. Like any other profession, management requires years of training and practice to get good at it.
3.  Paradox of management: The attitude that got you to that position isn’t the attitude that will make you successful at it. In fact, the opposite is true. If you try to manage people in the same way as you produced work as an individual contributor, you will fail.   
    When you encounter problems as a freshly minted manager, it can be all too easy to put your IC hat back on and fix them yourself. We call this “heroing”. Sometimes it’s necessary, but it’s always unsustainable in the long term.
4.  Why you’ll likely fail to scale as a manager: A startup is defined as a small company that scales with unnaturally high growth. As the company expands, it requires different types of talent, and it’s an all-too-common occurrence for the company’s growth rate to outstrip yours. When that happens, you can get “leveled”: a senior manager with more experience is recruited above you.  
    This can be bruising to the ego, but quite honestly, it shouldn’t be. Practically no one is capable of consistently scaling themselves at these speeds. Rather than taking it personally, you should realize this isn’t a zero sum game. Adding some new amazing VP above you will only give you more opportunities to grow, lift us all up, and expand the pie.
5.  Managing time: The first rule in time management is to ruthlessly protect your time. Whenever someone asks for your time, instead of accepting a meeting, ask whether their issue could be resolved with a Slack message, Google Doc, or email instead. If a meeting is inevitable, keep it as short as possible. Ensure that everyone is prepared for the meeting in order to make the most out of the time, and stack your meetings on specific days to ensure long periods of uninterrupted time outside those days where you can get focused work done.
6.  Getting things done: Your mind is made for having ideas, not for holding ideas. It’s a crappy office, and your brain did not evolve to remember, remind, prioritize, or manage relationships with more than four things. Any attempt to do so will cause anxiety.  
    Creative work takes long periods of uninterrupted time. It is disrupted by context switching.  
    Steps to GTD:   
    i. Capture: You want to capture everything so you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to do it.  
    ii. Clarify: For everything you capture, decide if it is actionable. If not, trash it, incubate it, or file it. If it is actionable, and it will take less than **two minutes**, do it now. Otherwise, delegate or defer it.  
    iii. Organize: Organize those actionable tasks by category and priority. File them under either _Today_, _Someday  
    iv. Reflect:_ Look over your lists frequently to determine what to do next. Do a weekly review to bring yourself current, update your lists, and clear your mind.  
    v. Engage: Ensure that you have long periods of uninterrupted time for any creative work. Do not get distracted by other tasks, or by incoming tasks (emails, slack msgs, etc.); these can be captured asynchronously.
7.  Villain, Victim, Hero: When we are not taking responsibility and we are blaming others (or ourselves), we fall into what we call the Drama Triangle  
    i. Villain: The stance of the villain is “It’s all your fault!”. Villains criticize, blame the victim, and set strict limits. They can be controlling, rigid, authoritative, angry, and unpleasant. They keep the victim feeling oppressed through threats and bullying. Villains yell and criticize, but they don’t actually solve any problems or help anyone else solve the problems.  
    ii. Victim: The stance of the victim is “Poor me!” Victims see themselves as victimized, oppressed, powerless, helpless, hopeless, dejected. They can deny any responsibility for their negative circumstances and deny possession of the power to change those circumstances. Victims have real difficulties making decisions, solving problems, finding much pleasure in life, or understanding their self-perpetuating behaviors.  
    iii. Hero: The stance of the hero is “Let me help you!” Heroes work hard to help and take care of other people, and they even need to help other people to feel good about themselves, while neglecting their own needs or not taking responsibility for meeting their own needs. Heroes are classically codependent and enablers. They need victims to help and often can’t allow the victim to succeed or get better. In terms of derailing resilience, heroes are frequently harried, overworked, tired, or caught in martyrdom while resentment festers underneath.  
    The key is realizing when you’re stuck in the Drama Triangle: pause, take a deep breath, and try to approach the problem with curiosity.
