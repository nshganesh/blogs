Trees & Graphs

1.  Should go for BFS or DFS approach.
2.  During deletion of a node, or interchanging of nodes -> Delete a node or replace the node value.
3.  Extra space can be a factor. DFS uses stack (function callstack), BFS uses queue (maximum element in a queue in a worst case is n/2).
4.  BFS starts visiting nodes from root, while DFS starts visiting nodes from the bottom.
5.  Do we need an array implementation of tree. (left child — 2\*root+1, right\_child 2\*root+2)
